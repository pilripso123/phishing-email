Email body: 
Hello everyone! I hope this email finds you all well. As you know, our 10 year anniversary is coming up and we have a treat for all of you. 
Aside from the pizza party we have planned, we want to show our gratitude and hand out bonuses for staying loyal to Pickle Rick Enterprises. They will be sent out via PayPal since it will arrive to you sooner and have less complications. If you don’t have a Paypal account, set one up beforehand since the link that is provided on this email is to claim your bonus.
